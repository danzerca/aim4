        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This can involve concatenating the retrieved documents with the original query or using them to provide additional context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based model like GPT-3, is used to generate a response based on the augmented input. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses because it has access to the additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG models are particularly useful in scenarios where the information needed to generate a response is not contained within the model's parameters but can be found in external documents or databases. This approach helps in improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses, especially for complex queries that require specific knowledge.\""

The key idea behind QLoRA is to use quantization and low-rank adaptation to make the fine-tuning process more efficient.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how QLoRA backpropagates gradients:\\n\\n1. **Quantization**: The model weights are quantized to reduce the memory footprint. This involves converting the weights from floating-point precision to a lower precision format (e.g., 8-bit integers). Quantization helps in reducing the memory usage and computational cost.\\n\\n2. **Low-Rank Adaptation**: Instead of updating the full weight matrices during fine-tuning, QLoRA updates low-rank approximations of the weight matrices. This is done by decomposing the weight matrices into low-rank components (e.g., using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition) and only updating these components during backpropagation.\\n\\n3. **Forward Pass**: During the forward pass, the quantized weights and low-rank components are used to compute the model's predictions. The low-rank components are combined with the quantized weights to approximate the original weight matrices.\\n\\n4. **Gradient Computation**: During backpropagation, gradients are computed with respect to the low-rank components and the quantized weights. The gradients are calculated based on the loss function and the model's predictions.\\n\\n5. **Gradient Update**: The low-rank components are updated using the computed gradients. Since the low-rank components are much smaller than the full weight matrices, this update is computationally efficient.\\n\\n6. **Dequantization (if needed)**: If the quantized weights need to be updated, they are first dequantized to their original precision, updated using the computed gradients, and then re-quantized. However, in many cases, the quantized weights remain fixed, and only the low-rank components are updated.\\n\\nBy combining quantization and low-rank adaptation, QLoRA achieves efficient fine-tuning of large language models with reduced memory and computational requirements. The key advantage is that it allows for the fine-tuning of large models on resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.\",\n",

This is achieved through techniques like 4-bit quantization, double quantization, and paged optimizers.\\n- **Traditional Fine-Tuning**: Requires substantial memory resources, often necessitating multiple high-end GPUs to fine-tune large models.\\n\\n#### Computational Resources\\n- **QLoRA**: By reducing memory requirements, QLoRA lowers the computational barriers, making it feasible for research organizations and individual researchers to fine-tune large models.\\n- **Traditional Fine-Tuning**: Demands significant computational resources, which can be a barrier for smaller organizations or individual researchers.\\n\\n#### Training Time\\n- **QLoRA**: Offers faster training times due to its reduced parameter footprint. For example, QLoRA can fine-tune a model to achieve near state-of-the-art performance in just 24 hours on a single GPU.\\n- **Traditional Fine-Tuning**: Generally requires longer training times due to the need to update all model parameters.\\n\\n#### Performance\\n- **QLoRA**: Maintains performance levels comparable to full 16-bit fine-tuning. For instance, models fine-tuned with QLoRA have achieved 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT on the Vicuna benchmark.\\n- **Traditional Fine-Tuning**: Typically achieves high performance but at the cost of higher computational and memory resources.\\n\\n#### Practical Applications\\n- **QLoRA**: Suitable for scenarios where computational resources are limited but high performance is still required. It is particularly useful for fine-tuning large models on specific tasks or domains without the need for extensive hardware.\\n- **Traditional Fine-Tuning**: More suitable for environments where computational resources are abundant and the primary goal is to achieve the highest possible performance without regard to resource constraints.\\n\\n### Summary\\nQLoRA offers a more resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning, making it accessible for a broader range of users while maintaining high performance. Traditional fine-tuning, while effective, requires significantly more computational and memory resources, making it less feasible for smaller organizations or individual researchers.',\n",

QLoRA provides a scalable solution that can handle larger models without a proportional increase in resource consumption.\\n\\n3. **Performance**: By leveraging quantization, QLoRA can maintain or even improve the performance of fine-tuned models.
